# This should be the central controller
# Make a class here and make functions for the api calls
# Put each class in a file like Section.py should have section class, with a __str__ and a __dict__ is required i think not sure

# also include api call to sign in, you should'nt hard cord the token

# I did section.py, you can take a look otherwise this is good work
